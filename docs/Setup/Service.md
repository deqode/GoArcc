GoArcc provides all the basic functionality before building any embedded service or microservice. GoArcc lets you focus only in your business logic of your application.

# What is Service
 Service is a micro-functionality or small module, or you can say it's a microservice. Which will be plugged into your existing codebase. Service are independent, and they can be easily plug-in and plug-out.
 
# Directory structure of a Service
- `service-name` - for ex- user-profile
  - `version-number` for ex. v1
    - `external-svc` - contains exposed APIs logic implementation.
    - `internal-svc` - contains unexposed API's logic implementation (only internal call).
    - `models` - database models, operations using [gorm](https://gorm.io/)
    - `pb` - autogenerated files from .proto file
    
# Creating a Service
A service schema will be defined inside a proto file. you can learn how to define a proto [here](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/gotutorial).<br/>
Also read about proto defining guideline of GoArcc [here](https://)

For Example you creating a service which will perform user related crud operation like creating, updating or deleting a User.<br/>
lets create a file `user.proto`. See the [sample proto](https://github.com/deqode/GoArcc/blob/main/modules/user-profile/v1/pb/user_profile.proto) file.<br/>
<b>for internal and external services, proto must be identical.</b>

## Generate the code from proto
:::tip 
Make sure you have installed all the required plugins into your `GOPATH`
:::
commands will be present into `generate.go` file.<br/>
OR<br/>
you can directly run `go generate` for code generation.

## Service implementation
- initialize your constructor in `service.go` file. [see the sample](https://github.com/deqode/GoArcc/blob/main/modules/user-profile/v1/external-svc/service.go)
- implement the interfaces which is generated into `pb/.._grpc.go` file.<br/>
[see the example implementation](https://github.com/deqode/GoArcc/tree/main/modules/user-profile/v1/external-svc)
  
## Service Registration into GoArcc
Your Service is ready, you can register you service to `grpc` or `rest` or `graphql`.
- see [example](https://github.com/deqode/GoArcc/blob/main/servers/rest/register.go) to register your service as REST.
- see [example](https://github.com/deqode/GoArcc/blob/main/servers/grpc/register.go) to register your service as gRPC.
- see [example](https://github.com/deqode/GoArcc/blob/main/servers/graphql/register.go) to register your service as graphQL.

You can find your running service into respective ports.
