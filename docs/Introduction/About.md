# What is GoArcc ?

When you start writing a Go project, GoArcc helps to set up all the initial code boilerplate for your project.
Initial boilerplate code means how you should organize your codebase and how you can write multiple services.
We have support for **REST**, **Graphql** as well as **gRPC**. 

We have implemented **logging**, **tracing**, **health check**, **Jaeger**, etc so that any developer will come and write services within a minute.

In short, **GoArcc is a boilerplate setup codebase for any monolithic(Architecture) based web/mobile applications which later converted into microservices(Architecture).**


## Why we need GoArcc ?

Nowadays whenever we start a new project we need to set up multiple things.
How you organize your codebase is a major concern and takes lots of time. 
So our team has worked on it and finally, we came up with a solution. 
Any web/mobile application whose backend is based upon monolith architecture 
can use our codebase and start writing services within a second.
we give you a setup of prewritten code which have multiple features like **tracing**, 
**metrics**, **logging**, **health check**, etc.We will go through later on this part.  

**Note: Currently we have only support for golang**
