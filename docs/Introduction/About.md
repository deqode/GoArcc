# What is GoArcc ?

When you start writing a Go project, GoArcc helps set up all the initial code boilerplate. Initial boilerplate code is how you organize your codebase and write multiple services. We have support for **REST**, **Graphql** and  **gRPC**. 

We have implemented **logging**, **tracing**, **health check**, **Jaeger**, etc. to help developers write multiple services within a minute.
In short, **GoArcc is a boilerplate setup codebase for any monolithic(Architecture) based web/mobile applications, which later converted into microservices(Architecture).**


## Why we need GoArcc ?

Nowadays, before setting up a new project, one needs to set up multiple things. Organizing the codebase is a primary concern for many and also takes a lot of time. As a result, our team tirelessly worked on it and eventually came up with a precise solution. Any web/mobile application whose backend is based upon monolith architecture can use our codebase and start writing services within seconds. We provide you with a setup of prewritten code that has multiple features like **tracing**, **metrics**, **logging**, **health check**, etc. This section will be covered later. 

**Note: At present, we only support Golang.**
