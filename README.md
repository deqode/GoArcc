# Go monolith with embedded microservices including GRPC,REST, graphQL and The Clean Architecture.

This project shows an example of how to implement monolith with embedded
microservices (a.k.a. modular monolith). This way you'll get many upsides
of monorepo without it complexity and at same time most of upsides of
microservice architecture without some of it complexity.

## Overview

### Structure of Go packages



### Features

- [X] Project structure (mostly) follows
  [Standard Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout).
- [X] Strict but convenient golangci-lint configuration.
- [X] Easily testable code (thanks to The Clean Architecture).
- [X] Avoids (and resists to) using global objects (to ensure embedded
  microservices won't conflict on these global objects).
- [X] CLI subcommands support using [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra).
- [X] Graceful shutdown support.
- [X] Configuration defaults can be overwritten by env vars and flags.
- [X] Example JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP API, with CORS support.
- [X] Example gRPC API:
    - [X] External and internal APIs on different host/port.
    - [X] gRPC services with and without token-based authentication.
    - [X] API design (mostly) follows
      [Google API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design) and
      [Google API Improvement Proposals](https://google.aip.dev/).
- [X] Example DAL (data access layer):
    - [X] PostgreSQL 11 (secure schema usage pattern).
- [X] Example tests, both unit and integration.
- [X] Production logging using [structlog](https://github.com/powerman/structlog).
- [X] Production metrics using Prometheus.
- [X] Docker and docker-compose support.
- [X] Smart test coverage report, with optional support for coveralls.io.
- [X] Linters for Dockerfile and shell scripts.
- [X] CI/CD setup for GitHub Actions and CircleCI.

## Development

### Requirements

- Go 1.16
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) 19.03+
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) 1.25+

### Setup



### Usage

To develop this project you'll need only standard tools: `go generate`,
`go test`, `go build`, `docker build`. Provided scripts are for
convenience only.


#### Cheatsheet

```sh

```

It's recommended to avoid `docker-compose down` - this command will also
remove docker's network for the project, and next `dc up -d` will create a
new networkâ€¦ repeat this many enough times and docker will exhaust
available networks, then you'll have to restart docker service or reboot.
